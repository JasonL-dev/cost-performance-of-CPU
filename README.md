# cost-performance-of-CPUs
**Background:**  
This is a project about cost performance of CPUs. The performance data came from https://www.spec.org/, and the cost data came from https://itprice.com/.   
https://www.spec.org/ is a professional website for performance testing of CPUs, java server, cloud and other computing systems.   
I crawled the table named 'cpu_2017_results' as the performance data of CPUs.  
https://itprice.com/ is a global price query tool for IT equipment and accessories.  

Develop tools:  
Language: Python  
IDE: Jupyter Notebook  
Database: Mysql  
Data visualization software: Tableau  

The main of this project is the csv file named 'cost_performance_of_CPUs' and the following gragh of Tableau.

For example, I want to buy a CPU around 3000 dollars, AMD EPYC 7402 will be a good choice.  

**Usage:**  
You can use the code file 'main' to crawl the lastest data, or you can establish gragh base on my csv file named 'cost_performance_of_CPUs' which updated in 2021.
